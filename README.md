# Project-ZERO
ACDGARI is a stationary product of interpreting enhanced machine learning and using sustainable methods to gather information from its surroundings on a small scale of a deserted planet/natural satellite without the need of manual labor. ACDGARI is a capsule-shaped instrument which will have have an array of equipment that allows the gathering of environmental, weather, thermal, hazardous (disastrous) data simultaneously. ACDGARI is destined to surpass conventional machines used in the past, e.g. rovers, to collect samples and data in terms of versatility, longevity and durability. Data collected from ACDGARI is extremely vital as humans will study different scales of planetary disasters.
